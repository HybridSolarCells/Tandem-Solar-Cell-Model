# Tandem-Solar-Cell-Model

This program models a silicon solar cell with an efficiency of 26.7% and a perovskite solar cell with an efficiency of 19.7%. These two subcells are then used to simulate the efficiency of a perovskite/Si tandem solar cell under standard test conditions. By using measured solar spectra and temperatures data this model can be extended to simulate the performance of realistic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells under real world climate conditions.

##Requirements

[Wolfram Mathematica] (https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)

##Installation

Download RealisticTandem.nb, Input.zip, and the [ASTM G173-03 Reference Spectra (ASTMG173.xls)] (http://rredc.nrel.gov/solar/spectra/am1.5/astmg173/astmg173.html) and include these files in the directory where you are performing the analysis. Unpack the file Input.zip and add the reference spectra into the folder Input. Open the file RealisticTandem.nb with Wolfram Mathematica and evaluate the notebook.
